    "## 1. What Is Sentinel?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentinel** is an AI-powered premarket forecasting engine designed to predict whether a stock will **continue** or **fade** after the opening bell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system combines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Historical **options flow data** (TradyFlow dataset)\n",
    "- Live **premarket data** (Polygon API)\n",
    "- Engineered volatility, flow, and momentum features\n",
    "- **Machine learning models** (LightGBM)\n",
    "- **Excel trade journaling** with SHAP-based explanations\n",
    "- A modern **Streamlit dashboard**, deployed on **Azure**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentinel bridges *research, machine learning, and real-time analytics* into one cohesive platform."

    "## 2. Why Build Sentinel?\n",
    "\n",
    "Premarket price action often contains early signals about market behavior—but most traders rely on intuition, not data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentinel aims to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quantify premarket strength and weakness\n",
    "- Estimate probability of continuation vs reversal\n",
    "- Log predictions, confidence, and features in an Excel trade journal\n",
    "- Provide a trader-friendly dashboard for daily forecasting\n",
    "- Demonstrate cloud deployment skills through an Azure architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "This project also serves as one of the **Big 4 Portfolio Projects**, showing expertise in:\n",
    "- Machine learning\n",
    "- Time-series forecasting\n",
    "- Feature engineering\n",
    "- Explainability (SHAP)\n",
    "- Full-stack data product development\n",
